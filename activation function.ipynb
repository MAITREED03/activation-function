    "Q1. What is an activation function in the context of artificial neural networks?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of artificial neural networks, an activation function is a mathematical operation applied to the output of a neuron or a layer of neurons. It introduces non-linearity to the network, allowing it to learn complex patterns and relationships in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The activation function determines whether a neuron should be activated (output a non-zero value) or not (output zero). It adds non-linear properties to the network, enabling it to approximate and learn complex functions. Without activation functions, the neural network would essentially be a linear model, and stacking multiple layers of linear operations would not increase the model's capacity to learn intricate patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common activation functions include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Sigmoid Function (Logistic): It squashes the input values between 0 and 1. It is often used in the output layer of a binary classification model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hyperbolic Tangent (tanh): Similar to the sigmoid function but ranges between -1 and 1, making it zero-centered. It helps mitigate the vanishing gradient problem better than the sigmoid.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU): It replaces all negative values in the input with zero and leaves positive values unchanged. ReLU has become popular due to its simplicity and effectiveness in training deep neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Leaky Rectified Linear Unit (Leaky ReLU): Similar to ReLU but allows a small, non-zero gradient for negative values, preventing dead neurons in the network.\n",

    "Parametric Rectified Linear Unit (PReLU): Similar to Leaky ReLU but allows the slope of the negative part to be learned during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exponential Linear Unit (ELU): It smoothens the transition for negative input values, introducing a non-zero slope and potentially mitigating the vanishing gradient problem."

    "\n",
    "σ(x)= 1/1+e−x\n",
    "Here's how the sigmoid activation function works:\n",
